data science works on prediction over collected stats and probability so the important topics from mathematics are :- 
       
***Statistics***

1. Difference between population and sample

2. Types of variables

3. Measures of central tendency

4. Measures of variability

5. Coefficient of variance

6. Skewness and Kurtosis

***Inferential statistics***


1. Normal distribution

2. Test hypotheses

3. Central limit theorem

4. Confidence interval

5. T-test

6. Type I and II errors

7. Student’s T distribution
